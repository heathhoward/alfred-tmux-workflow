# Open in Tmux Workflow for Alfred app

Alfred workflow to open current Finder or Path Finder path in iTerm2, in a Tmux session. The workflow is pretty much molded
to my needs, with a quite opinionated way of handling tmux. Still, I've found there's no default nor preferred way of
handling iTerm + tmux, say for example the embeded tmux integration in iTerm is quite unconfortable for my taste.

The workflow was initially meant to handle the actual opening of iTerm, connect to a tmux session and then cd to the
current path, but it may come to your needs to cd in an existing session, or a new one, or simply in bash or zsh.
